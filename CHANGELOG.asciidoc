2018/12/03: Changelog introduced.

2018/12/03: Relx has been updated to v3.27.0.

2018/12/03: Dependencies are no longer always rebuilt by
            default. Please check the documentation for
            information. A quick fix if this causes an
            issue is to add `FULL = 1` at the top of your
            Makefile.

2018/12/06: Change the default COVER_DATA_DIR to be the
            same as COVER_REPORT_DIR.

2019/06/20: `list-deps` now includes local applications
            found in the `APPS_DIR` directory.
